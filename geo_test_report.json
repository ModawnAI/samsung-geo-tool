      "groundTruth": "This is the official video guide 📝 on how to check your running level and train step by step with Running Coach on Galaxy Watch8 Series. Where does your running ability stand right now? You can find out through Running Coach on Galaxy Watch8 Series. Start with a simple test that measures your running level from 1 to 10, then follow a 3 to 5 week training plan tailored to your results. Running Coach helps you train at your own pace and chart your own path of progress.

It provides real-time audio guidance from your watch to notify you about your pace, distance and progress toward your goal regardless whether you're a beginner or an experienced runner.\r\nQ. Will my training be saved even if I don't hit my goal? And is it okay to do multiple sessions in a day?\r\nA: Yes, all your Running Coach training sessions are saved, even if you don’t meet your goal. This data can help adjust future training plans. However, we recommend completing only one session per day since multiple sessions may lead to excessive training load.\r\nQ. Can I use Running Coach on a treadmill?\r\nA: Running Coach is only available in outdoor environments where GPS signals are received. This is because the training program relies on real-time location data to calculate pace, distance and speed. Indoor environments do not provide a GPS signal, which can affect the accuracy of training data.\r\nQ: What is RPE?\r\nA: RPE stands for Rating of Perceived Exertion. It is an index that indicates the intensity you felt during the workout, from a scale of 1 to 10. Unlike objective stats like heart rate or speed, RPE reflects your condition subjectively. \r\n\r\n#GalaxyAI #GalaxyWatch8 #Samsung",
