1
00:00:34,425 --> 00:00:36,311
Stop taking selfies with your front camera.

2
00:00:36,336 --> 00:00:39,684
Start taking perfect 50 megapixel selfies with Flip7.

3
00:00:39,709 --> 00:00:41,795
Celebrate your moment with the rear camera.

4
00:00:43,715 --> 00:00:45,245
Perfect, just with one hand.

5
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:46,005
And of course,

6
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:47,659
never miss your bestie in the moment.

7
00:00:47,684 --> 00:00:48,379
“Hi bestie!”

8
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:52,974
This is not a filter,

9
00:00:52,999 --> 00:00:55,295
ProVisual Engine takes your picture quality

10
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,355
to the next level.

11
00:01:02,594 --> 00:01:03,788
Hi, everyone!

12
00:01:03,813 --> 00:01:05,948
This is my morning routine with Mochi!

13
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:07,793
First, Now Brief.

14
00:01:07,818 --> 00:01:09,433
It’s like having the personal assistant

15
00:01:09,458 --> 00:01:10,727
keeping me ahead of the day.

16
00:01:10,752 --> 00:01:11,327
For me,

17
00:01:11,352 --> 00:01:12,821
today is a day with Mochi.

18
00:01:12,887 --> 00:01:13,767
As you can see,

19
00:01:13,792 --> 00:01:14,794
it’s a big day.

20
00:01:14,819 --> 00:01:16,607
It’s Mochi’s first ever dog show.

21
00:01:16,829 --> 00:01:17,741
I am nervous.

22
00:01:17,766 --> 00:01:18,308
He is not.

23
00:01:18,382 --> 00:01:20,382
All the important things are right there.

24
00:01:20,407 --> 00:01:21,718
Even Mochi’s pictures.

25
00:01:21,743 --> 00:01:22,738
Obssessed.

26
00:01:22,863 --> 00:01:24,196
Competition time!

27
00:01:24,221 --> 00:01:26,322
Let’s check out some pro tips before the show.

28
00:01:26,395 --> 00:01:28,008
For our first victory.

29
00:01:28,155 --> 00:01:29,268
Full transparency.

30
00:01:29,293 --> 00:01:30,279
He didn’t win.

31
00:01:30,304 --> 00:01:31,259
But who cares?

32
00:01:31,284 --> 00:01:33,047
He gets first prize for cuteness.

33
00:01:36,761 --> 00:01:37,421
Food Vlogger:
Welcome back.

34
00:01:37,446 --> 00:01:39,042
I found this insane place.

35
00:01:39,067 --> 00:01:40,802
I have no idea what to try first…

36
00:01:40,827 --> 00:01:41,861
let’s find out!

37
00:01:42,581 --> 00:01:44,581
 Hey Gemini, can you tell me how to eat this?

38
00:01:44,966 --> 00:01:47,808
Gemini:
Wow! I see a delicious spread with Peking duck.

39
00:01:47,833 --> 00:01:50,262
Step 1: Place the duck as on the pancake.

40
00:01:50,287 --> 00:01:52,162
Step 2: Add the cucumber,

41
00:01:52,187 --> 00:01:54,542
spring onion, and wrap it like a mini burrito.

42
00:01:54,567 --> 00:01:55,695
Food Vlogger:
Which sauce do you recommend?

43
00:01:56,267 --> 00:01:59,085
Gemini:
That hoisin sauce is a traditional Peking duck sauce,

44
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:00,259
it’s a bit sweet.

45
00:02:00,702 --> 00:02:02,429
The red sauce is chili oil,

46
00:02:02,454 --> 00:02:04,235
it can get pretty spicy!

47
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:05,394
Food Vlogger:
You only live once, right?

48
00:02:10,005 --> 00:02:10,940
It’s too hot!

49
00:02:13,229 --> 00:02:13,729
Kai:
 Gemini,

50
00:02:14,049 --> 00:02:16,049
where are the best asian restaurants around here?

51
00:02:16,832 --> 00:02:19,126
GEMINI:
These are the top three asian restaurants near you.

52
00:02:20,372 --> 00:02:20,779
KAI:
Cool.

53
00:02:20,804 --> 00:02:22,312
Save them to my Samsung Notes.
