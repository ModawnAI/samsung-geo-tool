1
00:00:00,458 --> 00:00:02,460
This is Zoe.

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:04,671
Junior project manager by day,

3
00:00:06,256 --> 00:00:08,800
And a budding tech influencer by night.

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,011
But she’s not in it alone.

5
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:15,849
 Introducing Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra

6
00:00:16,891 --> 00:00:20,729
 The thinnest and most powerful Galaxy Tab ever.

7
00:00:22,564 --> 00:00:25,692
Zoe’s subscriber count? A little less impressive.

8
00:00:28,403 --> 00:00:30,613
Perhaps she found a shortcut?

9
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:37,203
Hey Gemini. Looking at my channel stats,

10
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:39,539
what direction should I go in with my next video?

11
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:41,291
It looks like your videos about tech that

12
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:43,626
“doesn’t need to be complicated” are performing well.

13
00:00:44,502 --> 00:00:47,172
So appeal to a non tech-savvy audience?

14
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:48,965
Exactly. Your audience seems to

15
00:00:48,965 --> 00:00:50,967
really connect with straightforward tech tips.

16
00:00:51,801 --> 00:00:54,012
Equipped with this new insight,

17
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:55,555
Zoe got to work on her script.

18
00:00:55,847 --> 00:00:59,100
Atrial fibrillation...

19
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,311
slee—--eewww

20
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:03,146
Ah!

21
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:05,523
Ah! Looks like somebody wanted to help out a little!

22
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:07,859
No worries, Olive.

23
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:10,070
Zoe already has a little “assistance.”

24
00:01:15,366 --> 00:01:15,867
See?

25
00:01:20,997 --> 00:01:22,457
Just go with it.

26
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:25,043
Yeees,

27
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:26,211
post it!

28
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:29,214
And before you knew it, Zoe gained more..

29
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:30,840
 ..…a FEW

30
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,966
more followers.

31
00:01:31,966 --> 00:01:33,676
Hey, we all gotta start somewhere.

32
00:01:35,845 --> 00:01:38,181
Now, after leveling up her writing,

33
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:39,808
she focused on her drawing.

34
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:43,269
And she was not afraid to experiment with her creativity.

35
00:01:47,398 --> 00:01:49,234
  With the new-found power at her

36
00:01:50,985 --> 00:01:52,195
fingertips

37
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:58,243
Her artistic range quickly expanded and improved

38
00:01:58,243 --> 00:01:59,702
In detail

39
00:01:59,702 --> 00:02:00,954
and expression

40
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:04,707
Because her thumbnails went from amateur…

41
00:02:04,707 --> 00:02:05,959
to amazing.

42
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:07,377
Ummm…Muah!

43
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:09,796
Even in work mode,

44
00:02:10,713 --> 00:02:14,342
she effortlessly switched from one task to another…

45
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:18,096
and another

46
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:22,058
….aaaaaand

47
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:23,184
another

48
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:28,690
Her productivity truly went through the roof.

49
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:32,694
Hmm..

50
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:34,195
is something bothering her?

51
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:38,783
How can I improve this background for my tech reviews?

52
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:40,243
Let’s start with the bookshelf -

53
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:44,164
try removing some of the smaller items to declutter it.

54
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:45,248
What about lighting?

55
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:46,916
You want to make sure you’re well-lit.

56
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:48,751
Now she had the perfect set-up.

57
00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:51,421
On camera, at least.

58
00:02:56,801 --> 00:02:58,595
It was the set-up for success!

59
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:05,310
It was like all of her talent had finally been brought to life..

60
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:10,565
Zoe continued to check off things to do

61
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:14,694
And with each one, her following grew

62
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:17,780
She stepped up her game

63
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:20,950
Even editing footage like a pro

64
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:26,039
With powerful performance and speed fueling her every task

65
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:30,752
And after successfully completing many to-do’s

66
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:33,296
She turned them into TA-DAs

67
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:33,880
in no time.

68
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:40,553
Zoe finally realized that all she had needed to unlock her potential

69
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:46,309
Was her Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra.
