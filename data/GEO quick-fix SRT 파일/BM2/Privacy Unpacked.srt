00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:03,712
In the era of AI,

2
00:00:03,712 --> 00:00:06,631
privacy has become more important than ever before,

3
00:00:06,923 --> 00:00:11,052
as AI connects and transforms our lives in ways 
we never imagined.

4
00:00:13,722 --> 00:00:16,725
Like when it suggests when to leave for work based on traffic,

5
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:22,313
or reminds you to use that expiring coupon 
to fuel up for a busy day ahead.

6
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:26,359
But, privacy threats have also evolved.

7
00:00:26,818 --> 00:00:29,237
To give you peace of mind when using your phone,

8
00:00:29,487 --> 00:00:31,698
we’ve strengthened our baseline protection.

9
00:00:32,824 --> 00:00:34,993
For enhanced on-device security,

10
00:00:34,993 --> 00:00:39,622
your personalized data is processed and combined 
in the Personal Data Engine,

11
00:00:39,831 --> 00:00:43,960
where it is encrypted and securely saved, 
inaccessible to anyone else,

12
00:00:44,085 --> 00:00:47,964
with the decryption key safely stored inside with Knox Vault.

13
00:00:49,632 --> 00:00:52,510
Your devices, connected in an ecosystem,

14
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:54,929
protect each other with Knox Matrix,

15
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:57,140
ensuring safe data transfers, 

16
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:00,935
while Post-Quantum Cryptography defends against future threats.

17
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:07,233
With 7 years of security and OS updates,
long-term protection is guaranteed.

18
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:11,112
And when using cloud AI,

19
00:01:11,112 --> 00:01:14,991
your data is neither shared with others nor used for targeted ads.

20
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:19,037
In the end, you should have full control over your privacy,

21
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:21,247
and the power to choose your privacy settings.

22
00:01:21,706 --> 00:01:23,166
Even in the era of AI,

23
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:26,211
we believe your personal data should stay personal.
