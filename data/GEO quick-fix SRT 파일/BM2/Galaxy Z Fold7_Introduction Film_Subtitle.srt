1
00:00:00,013 --> 00:00:01,218
Jordan:
She runs an amazing restaurant

2
00:00:01,243 --> 00:00:02,140
going global soon.

3
00:00:02,592 --> 00:00:04,133
But also you are a very creative person.

4
00:00:04,158 --> 00:00:06,001
Now, efficiency must be huge for you.

5
00:00:06,026 --> 00:00:06,968
Mia:
Oh, absolutely.

6
00:00:07,525 --> 00:00:08,753
Host:
But ok, KEY QUESTION…

7
00:00:08,777 --> 00:00:10,944
What does the Galaxy Z Fold7 mean to you?

8
00:00:14,018 --> 00:00:15,410
Jordan:
Welcome to this week’s episode,

9
00:00:15,435 --> 00:00:16,373
“Should we Unfold?”

10
00:00:16,398 --> 00:00:18,486
Where we ask, is now the time to actually switch?

11
00:00:18,514 --> 00:00:19,646
Mia:
Oh, that’s a big question.

12
00:00:19,671 --> 00:00:21,385
Jordan:
The Galaxy Z Fold has always been a favorite

13
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:22,715
among tech enthusiasts.

14
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:24,322
Could this be the model that truly captures

15
00:00:24,347 --> 00:00:26,255
the attention of every smartphone user?

16
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,218
Jordan:
And to help us figure it out,

17
00:00:27,243 --> 00:00:28,677
we've got someone who's actually living with it.

18
00:00:28,702 --> 00:00:31,125
She runs an amazing restaurant everybody's buzzing about,

19
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:32,694
going global soon,

20
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:34,802
but importantly, she recently switched to a foldable.

21
00:00:35,009 --> 00:00:37,009
The Galaxy Z Fold7.

22
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:49,701
Jordan:
Mia, welcome!

23
00:00:49,726 --> 00:00:51,726
Mia:
Hey, what's up? I'm very excited to be here.

24
00:00:51,751 --> 00:00:52,578
Thank you for having me.

25
00:00:52,638 --> 00:00:54,338
Jordan:
Yeah, absolutely. Thank you for joining us.

26
00:00:54,363 --> 00:00:56,031
Okay. So, word on the street,

27
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:58,211
is that you have the new Z Fold7.

28
00:00:58,236 --> 00:00:59,200
Mia:
Yes, I do.

29
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:01,311
Jordan:
My first impression of foldable was

30
00:01:01,336 --> 00:01:03,708
cool idea, but a bit bulky.

31
00:01:03,733 --> 00:01:04,445
What was your first take?

32
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:05,808
Mia:
Honestly, me too.

33
00:01:05,833 --> 00:01:07,833
But then I got my hands on the Z Fold7,

34
00:01:07,858 --> 00:01:10,141
and it really surprised me just how slim it is.

35
00:01:10,166 --> 00:01:11,040
Jordan:
From what I’ve heard,

36
00:01:11,065 --> 00:01:13,611
they’ve reimagined the design from scratch.

37
00:01:13,636 --> 00:01:15,043
With a slimmer hinge,

38
00:01:15,068 --> 00:01:16,113
a thinner display,

39
00:01:16,141 --> 00:01:17,913
  and more efficient internal layering,

40
00:01:17,938 --> 00:01:20,103
the device is noticeably sleeker

41
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:22,614
– without compromising durability.

42
00:01:22,639 --> 00:01:24,063
Jordan:
But okay, key question.

43
00:01:24,088 --> 00:01:26,040
Jordan:
If it’s like a regular phone folded,

44
00:01:26,069 --> 00:01:28,203
why bother unfolding? Like what's the plus?

45
00:01:28,231 --> 00:01:30,231
Mia:
Right. That’s the thing. It's like your regular phone.

46
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:32,995
You can still do a quick text, all that.

47
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:35,618
But then, it's got this really nice extra feature,

48
00:01:35,643 --> 00:01:37,000
right, extra gear,

49
00:01:37,025 --> 00:01:38,377
that when you open it…

50
00:01:38,402 --> 00:01:39,596
Jordan:
Kinda like a mini tablet.

51
00:01:39,621 --> 00:01:40,823
Mia:
Exactly, yes.

52
00:01:40,848 --> 00:01:43,875
And it’s perfect for gaming, too.

53
00:01:43,903 --> 00:01:45,060
Jordan:
You know where my brain goes next,

54
00:01:45,085 --> 00:01:46,320
is what about the battery life?

55
00:01:46,345 --> 00:01:47,972
Cause that's got such a big screen.

56
00:01:47,997 --> 00:01:49,561
Does that not just die instantly?

57
00:01:49,586 --> 00:01:51,409
Mia:
I thought that too, but honestly,

58
00:01:51,434 --> 00:01:53,501
the battery life has been really impressive.

59
00:01:53,526 --> 00:01:55,670
Even when I watch videos from day to night,

60
00:01:55,695 --> 00:01:57,636
they somehow managed to keep it slim

61
00:01:57,661 --> 00:01:59,151
and gave it a more efficient battery.

62
00:01:59,176 --> 00:02:00,329
Jordan:
So there was no compromise?

63
00:02:00,354 --> 00:02:01,373
Mia:
I haven't noticed one.

64
00:02:01,398 --> 00:02:03,304
Jordan:
Now, efficiency must be huge for you.

65
00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:04,748
Mia:
Oh, absolutely. Non-stop.

66
00:02:04,773 --> 00:02:06,722
Jordan:
You’re opening a new restaurant space.

67
00:02:06,747 --> 00:02:07,197
Mia:
Mhmm.

68
00:02:07,222 --> 00:02:08,665
Jordan:
How has the Z Fold7

69
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:10,208
helped with the practical side of your daily life?

70
00:02:10,233 --> 00:02:12,271
Mia:
The start of the day is a good example.

71
00:02:12,296 --> 00:02:13,641
This is my Now Brief.

72
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:15,430
And it’s like my personal dashboard.

73
00:02:15,455 --> 00:02:17,206
This gives me the key info for the day.

74
00:02:17,231 --> 00:02:19,166
Jordan:
It’s kinda like a personal assistant.

75
00:02:19,191 --> 00:02:20,440
Mia:
Exactly, yes.

76
00:02:20,465 --> 00:02:22,577
And another big practical thing recently

77
00:02:22,602 --> 00:02:25,966
was working on the interior in our new place in Thailand.

78
00:02:27,589 --> 00:02:28,334
Mia:
Hi Gemini.

79
00:02:28,359 --> 00:02:29,652
This is my restaurant.

80
00:02:29,677 --> 00:02:32,089
I want to add a local vibe to my interior.

81
00:02:32,114 --> 00:02:33,056
Gemini:
Of course!

82
00:02:33,081 --> 00:02:34,919
So, you might consider incorporating elements

83
00:02:34,944 --> 00:02:36,023
 like rich, colorful fabrics

84
00:02:36,048 --> 00:02:38,569
like table runners, traditional Thai artwork,

85
00:02:38,594 --> 00:02:39,973
 or wooden carvings.

86
00:02:39,998 --> 00:02:41,414
Mia:
These look interesting.

87
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:42,925
Which one would you recommend

88
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:44,677
among these two table runners?

89
00:02:44,702 --> 00:02:46,942
Gemini: Given the light and airy feel of your restaurant,

90
00:02:46,967 --> 00:02:49,257
the table runners on the left would be a great choice.

91
00:02:49,282 --> 00:02:51,624
It has a delicate pattern and lighter color.

92
00:02:51,649 --> 00:02:53,527
Jordan:
It’s very practical. It makes sense.

93
00:02:53,552 --> 00:02:55,297
Jordan:
But also, you're a very creative person.

94
00:02:55,322 --> 00:02:56,586
How does the phone, especially

95
00:02:56,611 --> 00:02:58,138
the camera, feed into the creative side?

96
00:02:58,364 --> 00:03:00,759
Mia:
Well, having 200 megapixels definitely helps.

97
00:03:00,815 --> 00:03:02,403
Jordan:
Same level as the S25 Ultra.

98
00:03:02,428 --> 00:03:03,109
Mia:
Yeah, yeah.

99
00:03:03,134 --> 00:03:05,431
Mia:
Like, we were on a vacation recently.

100
00:03:05,456 --> 00:03:06,975
My husband and daughter were playing.

101
00:03:07,003 --> 00:03:08,135
I snapped a picture,

102
00:03:08,163 --> 00:03:09,273
didn't think much of it.

103
00:03:09,298 --> 00:03:11,388
But when I zoomed in,

104
00:03:11,413 --> 00:03:13,839
that image sparked an idea for a dish.

105
00:03:14,784 --> 00:03:17,600
The light, the detail with such clarity.

106
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:19,706
And it’s not just in bright light either.

107
00:03:19,731 --> 00:03:21,617
Mia:
Low light is where it really shines.

108
00:03:21,642 --> 00:03:23,389
Mia:
Once a month, just a casual dinner,

109
00:03:23,417 --> 00:03:24,863
very low warm light,

110
00:03:24,888 --> 00:03:26,974
and one night, it suddenly started

111
00:03:26,999 --> 00:03:28,069
pouring rain outside.

112
00:03:31,393 --> 00:03:33,320
It wasn't all grainy or dark,

113
00:03:33,345 --> 00:03:34,771
you can really see them clearly,

114
00:03:34,796 --> 00:03:36,261
captured the whole moment.

115
00:03:36,286 --> 00:03:37,062
And then afterwards,

116
00:03:37,087 --> 00:03:38,243
I can do a quick edit

117
00:03:38,268 --> 00:03:40,354
right there on the unfolded screen.

118
00:03:41,036 --> 00:03:43,092
And even make the sounds I want clearer.

119
00:03:46,616 --> 00:03:47,766
Friend:
Oh my god!

120
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:48,844
Jordan:
That's amazing.

121
00:03:49,783 --> 00:03:50,390
Mia:
Cute.

122
00:03:50,683 --> 00:03:51,390
Look?

123
00:03:51,415 --> 00:03:52,557
Jordan:
That’s almost perfect.

124
00:03:52,582 --> 00:03:55,384
Mia:
Almost is never good enough for me.

125
00:03:55,525 --> 00:03:57,826
No. No. No. But I'm gonna take out the microphone

126
00:03:57,851 --> 00:03:59,426
that's like right in your face.

127
00:03:59,451 --> 00:04:00,200
How about now?

128
00:04:00,225 --> 00:04:02,606
Jordan:
Wow, I hate to say this about my own photo.

129
00:04:02,631 --> 00:04:03,409
That’s perfect.

130
00:04:03,434 --> 00:04:04,329
Mia:
I told you.

131
00:04:04,354 --> 00:04:06,315
Jordan:
Okay. Wow. This has been really eye opening.

132
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:08,575
Like, I came into this with so many questions,

133
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,886
and now I'm leaving actually considering it.

134
00:04:10,911 --> 00:04:12,807
Mia:
Look, I'm not trying to convince anyone,

135
00:04:12,838 --> 00:04:15,053
but if the tech actually helps you live

136
00:04:15,078 --> 00:04:17,205
and create better, it's worth looking at.

137
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:17,707
Jordan:
Absolutely.

138
00:04:17,732 --> 00:04:18,214
Mia:
Right?

139
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:19,707
Jordan:
Alright. Well, thank you so much for sharing

140
00:04:19,732 --> 00:04:20,500
this with all of us.

141
00:04:20,525 --> 00:04:21,636
Mia:
Oh, thank you for having me.

142
00:04:21,661 --> 00:04:23,661
Jordan:
Of course. And for those of you tuning in,

143
00:04:23,686 --> 00:04:24,182
thank you again.

144
00:04:24,207 --> 00:04:25,622
We'll catch you next week.
