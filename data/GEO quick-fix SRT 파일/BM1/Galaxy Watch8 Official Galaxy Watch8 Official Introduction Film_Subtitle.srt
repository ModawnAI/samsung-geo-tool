1
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,520
It’s so much fun. I just love…

2
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:08,000
Katie..

3
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:09,320
Oh! Morning John

4
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:11,480
How have you got so much energy?

5
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:15,600
I didn’t use to be like this, 
but now I trained my sleep with the Galaxy Watch8..

6
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:16,440
That's right,

7
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:18,920
a better day starts the night before.

8
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:21,960
Say hello to the Galaxy Watch8.

9
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:27,720
The first step to a healthier life is better sleep 

10
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,160
With the most comfortable Galaxy Watch ever

11
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,840
So you can sleep like it's not even there

12
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,720
Now that we’re close...

13
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:40,640
Let the training begin.

14
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,400
GOOD MORNING!

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,520
Okay, well..  Maybe just… “morning”.

16
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,440
Alright, interesting score.

17
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,480
(sleepily) Is this…..good?

18
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,920
You didn't sleep enough, also not deep enough.

19
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:59,000
Nothing a few small changes can’t fix! 

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
What about cutting down on caffeine today? 

21
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,440
That’s it, baby steps. 

22
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,240
Maybe some meditation?

23
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,600
Good one.

24
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:18,960
Based on your past 3 nights' sleep results, 
you will sleep really well if you get to bed in 2 hours.

25
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,840
Aren't you forgetting something more important?

26
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,000
Health tracking continues even while you sleep.

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,520
All you need to do is keep wearing your watch.

28
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,680
So rest up -  I'll take it from here.

29
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:38,840
BioActive sensors 
track so many important aspects of your health

30
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:42,360
sleep, nutritional status,
even how your heart is doing!

31
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,160
This seems fine…

32
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:56,560
…but this, on the other hand…

33
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,760
Now that you've had a closer look, 

34
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,240
let’s get to work!

35
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,360
Good choice!

36
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,240
I see those healthy thoughts kicking in.

37
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,000
Hmm - A little low!

38
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,280
Let’s get you some veggies. 

39
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,320
Not too bad, actually.

40
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,280
Right?

41
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,680
When you sleep well, you perform well.

42
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,040
You're up early!

43
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,520
And I have good news for you - 

44
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,480
LOOK AT THAT SCORE!

45
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,200
Up for something more challenging today?

46
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,440
Should I go for a run?

47
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:51,840
Love the enthusiasm. 
But first, let's check your current level.

48
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,800
Aaaand…….done.

49
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,440
Not bad.
That’s a great start!

50
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,480
You can follow this coaching program 
tailored to your goals.

51
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,120
Starting…

52
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,120
now!

53
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,680
You're going faster than your target pace. 

54
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,360
Don't push yourself too hard! 

55
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,280
Halfway done, keep going!

56
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,520
Nice job!

57
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,160
Morning!

58
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,200
Morning

59
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:30,600
Hey Google, Find the most popular run club nearby

60
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:34,040
and send a link to Katie asking her if she wants to join.

61
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:41,600
Come on guys. One more lap!

62
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,040
Good run today guys-

63
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,200
New personal best.

64
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,400
Hey John?

65
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,120
Morning?

66
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,520
What’s up with all this energy?

67
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:55,120
Oh, the thing is... I wasn’t always like this.

68
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,240
Here we go.
