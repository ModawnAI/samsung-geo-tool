1
00:00:02,286 --> 00:00:03,112
Wake up Addison.

2
00:00:04,382 --> 00:00:07,633
Big day, new city, new job

3
00:00:09,616 --> 00:00:13,266
and my new Galaxy S24 FE, with Galaxy AI.

4
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:15,165
 Let’s go.

5
00:00:16,509 --> 00:00:18,336
 I finally got this internship -

6
00:00:19,132 --> 00:00:21,496
- oh wait, perfect selfie spot.

7
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,823
Oh nice, I can use Photo Assist to erase that guy…

8
00:00:27,848 --> 00:00:29,373
…a move here,

9
00:00:30,504 --> 00:00:31,501
just like that.

10
00:00:32,567 --> 00:00:35,034
Ah! This is too fun, I’m gonna be late!

11
00:00:35,745 --> 00:00:37,301
Phew, made it.

12
00:00:37,345 --> 00:00:38,901
I can do this.

13
00:00:41,078 --> 00:00:42,834
 Oh, maybe I can help out.

14
00:00:43,234 --> 00:00:44,456
Let me give this a try.

15
00:00:44,924 --> 00:00:46,412
Long press,

16
00:00:46,436 --> 00:00:48,078
…circle the problem,

17
00:00:48,103 --> 00:00:49,834
 see every step.

18
00:00:49,946 --> 00:00:51,946
Anddd solved!

19
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:53,412
Whoa, how’d you do that?

20
00:00:53,436 --> 00:00:54,301
It’s cool right?

21
00:00:58,413 --> 00:01:00,212
Time for a little break.

22
00:01:00,346 --> 00:01:02,346
Gotta keep my winning streak.

23
00:01:03,636 --> 00:01:06,078
The bigger screen… smoother graphics,

24
00:01:06,103 --> 00:01:09,590
and way less lag with this faster processor, it’s unreal!

25
00:01:10,323 --> 00:01:11,367
Nothing can stop me now-

26
00:01:13,034 --> 00:01:14,701
Gibt es ein vegetarisches Menü?

27
00:01:14,725 --> 00:01:16,301
 Is there a vegetarian menu?

28
00:01:16,325 --> 00:01:17,212
Of course!

29
00:01:17,679 --> 00:01:19,901
 I heard the potato empanadas are great.

30
00:01:19,925 --> 00:01:23,634
Natürlich habe ich gehört, dass die Kartoffel-Empanadas großartig sind.

31
00:01:23,658 --> 00:01:26,945
Making new friends here will be easy with this. Love it.

32
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:30,255
Almost done, what a day.

33
00:01:30,768 --> 00:01:33,034
An invite out? Count me in.

34
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,501
Whoa… Look at this view.

35
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,056
Good thing I was recording!

36
00:01:42,679 --> 00:01:45,434
They have to see this in Slow-mo.

37
00:01:49,057 --> 00:01:51,057
Let me quickshare this to the group…

38
00:01:51,391 --> 00:01:52,123
 now.

39
00:01:57,457 --> 00:01:58,856
 Is it too dark here?

40
00:02:00,302 --> 00:02:01,767
Looks like it doesn’t matter!

41
00:02:04,368 --> 00:02:06,368
(Sigh) Finally home.

42
00:02:07,036 --> 00:02:09,036
 My phone lasted longer than I did.

43
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:16,128
Wouldn’t have made it through my first day without everything the S24 FE has packed into it.

44
00:02:16,396 --> 00:02:18,373
Oh my god, so worth it.

45
00:02:20,506 --> 00:02:24,351
The Galaxy S24 FE with Galaxy AI is here.
