Hi, I'm Lara Jade a New York-based fashion and beauty photographer.

2
00:00:12,887 --> 00:00:13,722
Hello, I’m Jay Lim,

3
00:00:13,722 --> 00:00:16,182
a fashion photographer.

4
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:17,684
For this project,

5
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:19,352
I shot with the Galaxy S25 Edge

6
00:00:19,352 --> 00:00:22,856
at Seoul Fashion Week, Korea’s biggest fashion event.

7
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:27,068
Using the Galaxy S25 Edge as my primary creative tool in this setting

8
00:00:27,068 --> 00:00:29,487
allowed me to capture that atmosphere in detail.

9
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:32,490
My first thought was, wow,

10
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:34,743
I didn’t expect a phone to be this slim.

11
00:00:34,743 --> 00:00:38,788
The S25 Edge allowed me to shoot with 
total confidence and freedom.

12
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:41,291
In fashion photography,

13
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:44,711
you’ve got to capture every fabric texture 
and accessory detail.

14
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:50,633
The S25 Edge’s 200MP camera brought all of that out so clearly.

15
00:00:50,633 --> 00:00:55,430
The S25 Edge reminded me of how I work with my 24-70mm lens

16
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:57,849
 because it offers a similar flexibility and speed.

17
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:00,935
Having control over

18
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:04,397
 ISO and shutter speed myself,

19
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:05,482
that was the part I really loved.

20
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:10,779
I used to spend so much time thinking and time spent in front of the computer editing.

21
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:12,947
Now it feels like a thing of the past.

22
00:01:12,947 --> 00:01:13,823
Streamlined.

23
00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:16,701
The S25 Edge is not only a sleek device,

24
00:01:16,701 --> 00:01:19,245
 it streamlines the entire creative process.

25
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:22,373
And something a lot of photographers I think would be excited to use.
