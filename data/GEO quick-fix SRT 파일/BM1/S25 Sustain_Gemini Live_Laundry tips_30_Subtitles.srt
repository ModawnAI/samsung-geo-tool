00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:12,720
How should I wash my dress?

2
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,680
You should use a delicate, cold cycle.

3
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:15,440
OK!

4
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:17,120
Do I just put it in?

5
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,280
Remember to turn it inside out

6
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:19,360
to protect the sequins.

7
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,240
Can I put it in the dryer?

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,000
The icon on the tag says no.

9
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,360
Thank goodness I asked.

10
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:26,960
You just saved date night.
