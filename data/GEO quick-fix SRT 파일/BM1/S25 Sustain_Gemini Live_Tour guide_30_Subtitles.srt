1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:02,160
This place is bigger than I thought…

2
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:07,360
So we’ve only got one hour...

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:08,960
Could you plan us a tour?

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,480
I see you're at the Leeum Museum.

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,280
Shall we focus on traditional Korean art?

6
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:14,680
Well, we are in Korea so...

7
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:15,200
let's do it!

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:16,560
Great!

9
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,680
Head to the M1 building to see historic treasures...

10
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,160
This book...

11
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,320
isn't it fascinating?

12
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,840
That's not a book, it’s a roof tile.

13
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:27,000
Often found on the houses of the rich and noble…
